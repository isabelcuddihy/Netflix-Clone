# 📺 Netflix Clone

A Netflix-inspired web application built using React, Firebase, and TMDB API, allowing users to browse and view trailers for the latest and most popular movies and TV shows.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This Netflix clone is a web application that replicates some of the key features of Netflix, such as browsing movies and TV shows, watching trailers, and viewing content based on various categories like trending, popular, and critically acclaimed. The application dynamically pulls data from The Movie Database (TMDB) API to display up-to-date content.

- **Interactive Trailers**: Click on a movie or TV show poster to watch its trailer (powered by React YouTube and movie-trailer libraries).
- **Real-time Data Fetching**: The app updates in real-time with the latest information from TMDB.

### 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Front-End**: JavaScript, React, CSS
- **Backend (Future Scope)**: Node.js, Firebase (Firestore)
- **APIs**: The Movie Database (TMDB) API, Firebase Hosting, and Firestore
- **Libraries**: Axios (for API calls), React YouTube, movie-trailer

## 🔄 APIs and Data Sources

This project pulls data from **TMDB API** to display movies and TV shows. We used **Axios** to make API requests and retrieve data, and **Firebase Firestore** for potential future enhancements like user authentication and watchlist management.

## 📝 Known Issues

- **Video Playback**: The video played upon clicking the poster is not always the trailer. Sometimes, it may show a behind-the-scenes clip or a bonus featurette. This is due to the limitations of the movie-trailer library fetching the first YouTube video related to the search term.

## 🌟 Future Enhancements

- **User Authentication**: Allow users to create accounts, log in, and manage their profiles.
- **Watchlist Feature**: Users can add or remove movies and TV shows from their personal watchlists.
- **Profile Customization**: Users can select and customize their profile avatars.
